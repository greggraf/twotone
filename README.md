# Two Tone

Take an image and make it greyscale, then add a third color for highlight

## in progress
- write a basic test and run it, see about jest also

## To Do

Put these in order

- Figure out testing - read svelte docs
- Make clicking on the image toggle a large version and a small version
- is there a reason that the image takes so long to load some times
- is there a memory leak?
- test on an actual phone
- long press to update color swatch (store swatches in local storage?)
